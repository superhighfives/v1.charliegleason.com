The second single from my record _One For Sorrow, Two For Joy_, [Rugby](https://rugby.wearebrightly.com/) is a homage to the humble GIF. Powered by [Giphy's API](https://api.giphy.com/), it creates a fresh mobile-friendly music video with every viewing.

In a way, it's the true spiritual successor to my first music video [Tweetflight](http://tweetflight.wearebrightly.com/), trading text for visuals. And there's nothing quite like Hamilton accompanying me every time I sing "raise a glass".
