[Moran & Cato](http://moranandcato.com) came from wanting to share incredible acoustic performances of local musicians online. I, along with my friends, set up a space in a local warehouse, and started recording bands. [The first episode](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gbl0L63wm8&feature=player_embedded) launched to a great reception, and the project ~~is ongoing~~ was fun while it lasted.

Also there is a bunch of CSS animation on the site, because it's incredibly fun.
